# CHANGELOG

## v2.6.0 (-.-.2021)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** Support for the New Relic observability platform. Sample of the client library might be
  found [here](https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic). (Thanks @arku31)   
New Relic middleware is a part of the HTTP plugin, thus configuration should be inside it:

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "new_relic" ]
  new_relic:
    app_name: "app"
    license_key: "key"
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

License key and application name could be set via environment variables: (leave `app_name` and `license_key` empty)

- license_key: `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`.
- app_name: `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`.

To set the New Relic attributes, the PHP worker should send headers values withing the `rr_newrelic` header key.
Attributes should be separated by the `:`, for example `foo:bar`, where `foo` is a key and `bar` is a value. New Relic
attributes sent from the worker will not appear in the HTTP response, they will be sent directly to the New Relic.

To see the sample of the PHP library, see the @arku31 implementation: https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic

The special key which PHP may set to overwrite the transaction name is: `transaction_name`. For
example: `transaction_name:foo` means: set transaction name as `foo`. By default, `RequestURI` is used as the
transaction name.

```php
        $resp = new \Nyholm\Psr7\Response();
        $rrNewRelic = [
            'shopId:1', //custom data
            'auth:password', //custom data
            'transaction_name:test_transaction' //name - special key to override the name. By default it will use requestUri.
        ];

        $resp = $resp->withHeader('rr_newrelic', $rrNewRelic);
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è New plugin: `TCP`. The TCP plugin is used to handle raw TCP payload with a bi-directional [protocol](tcp/docs/tcp.md) between the RR server and PHP worker.

PHP client library: https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-tcp

Configuration:
```yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php ../../psr-worker-tcp-cont.php"

tcp:
  servers:
    server1:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:7778
      delimiter: "\r\n"
    server2:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8811
      read_buf_size: 10
    server3:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8812
      delimiter: "\r\n"
      read_buf_size: 1

  pool:
    num_workers: 5
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è New HTTP middleware: `http_metrics`. 
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "http_metrics" ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```
All old and new http metrics will be available after the middleware is activated. Be careful, this middleware may slow down your requests. New metrics:

    - `rr_http_requests_queue_sum` - number of queued requests.
    - `rr_http_no_free_workers_total` - number of the occurrences of the `NoFreeWorkers` errors.  
  

-----
  
- ‚úèÔ∏è New file server to serve static files. It works on a different address, so it doesn't affect the HTTP performance. It uses advanced configuration specific for the static file servers. It can handle any number of directories with its own HTTP prefixes.
Config:

```yaml
fileserver:
  # File server address
  #
  # Error on empty
  address: 127.0.0.1:10101
  # Etag calculation. Request body CRC32.
  #
  # Default: false
  calculate_etag: true

  # Weak etag calculation
  #
  # Default: false
  weak: false

  # Enable body streaming for the files more than 4KB
  #
  # Default: false
  stream_request_body: true

  serve:
    # HTTP prefix
    #
    # Error on empty
  - prefix: "/foo"

    # Directory to serve
    #
    # Default: "."
    root: "../../../tests"

    # When set to true, the server tries minimizing CPU usage by caching compressed files
    #
    # Default: false
    compress: false

    # Expiration duration for inactive file handlers. Units: seconds.
    #
    # Default: 10, use a negative value to disable it.
    cache_duration: 10

    # The value for the Cache-Control HTTP-header. Units: seconds
    #
    # Default: 10 seconds
    max_age: 10

    # Enable range requests
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests
    #
    # Default: false
    bytes_range: true

  - prefix: "/foo/bar"
    root: "../../../tests"
    compress: false
    cache_duration: 10s
    max_age: 10
    bytes_range: true
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è `on_init` option for the `server` plugin. `on_init` code executed before the regular command and can be used to warm up the application for example. Failed `on_init` command doesn't affect the main command, so, the RR will continue to run.

Config:
```yaml
# Application server settings (docs: https://roadrunner.dev/docs/php-worker)
server:
  on_init:
    # Command to execute before the main server's command
    #
    # This option is required if using on_init
    command: "any php or script here"
    
    # Script execute timeout
    #
    # Default: 60s [60m, 60h], if used w/o units its means - NANOSECONDS.
    exec_timeout: 20s
    
    # Environment variables for the worker processes.
    #
    # Default: <empty map>
    env:
      - SOME_KEY: "SOME_VALUE"
      - SOME_KEY2: "SOME_VALUE2" 

  # ..REGULAR SERVER OPTIONS...
```

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: GRPC server will show message when started.
- üêõ Fix: Static plugin headers were added to all requests. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/115)

## v2.5.2 (27.10.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: panic in the TLS layer. The `http` plugin used `http` server instead of `https` in the rootCA routine.

## v2.5.1 (22.10.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: [base64](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/86) response instead of json in some edge cases.

## v2.5.0 (20.10.2021)

# üíî Breaking change:

- üî® Some drivers now use a new `config` key to handle local configuration. Involved plugins and drivers:
- `plugins`: `broadcast`, `kv`
- `drivers`: `memory`, `redis`, `memcached`, `boltdb`.

### Old style:

```yaml
broadcast:
  default:
    driver: memory
    interval: 1
```

### New style:

```yaml
broadcast:
  default:
    driver: memory
      config: { } <--------------- NEW
```

```yaml
kv:
  memory-rr:
    driver: memory
    config: <--------------- NEW
      interval: 1

kv:
  memcached-rr:
    driver: memcached
    config: <--------------- NEW
      addr:
        - "127.0.0.1:11211"

broadcast:
  default:
    driver: redis
    config: <------------------ NEW
      addrs:
        - "127.0.0.1:6379"
```

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** GRPC plugin update to v2.
- ‚úèÔ∏è [Roadrunner-plugins](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins) repository. This is the new home for the
  roadrunner plugins with documentation, configuration samples, and common problems.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** Let's Encrypt support. RR now can obtain an SSL certificate/PK for your domain automatically. Here is
  the new configuration:

```yaml
    ssl:
      # Host and port to listen on (eg.: `127.0.0.1:443`).
      #
      # Default: ":443"
      address: "127.0.0.1:443"

      # Use ACME certificates provider (Let's encrypt)
      acme:
        # Directory to use as a certificate/pk, account info storage
        #
        # Optional. Default: rr_cache
        certs_dir: rr_le_certs

        # User email
        #
        # Used to create LE account. Mandatory. Error on empty.
        email: you-email-here@email

        # Alternate port for the http challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 80
        alt_http_port: 80,


        # Alternate port for the tls-alpn-01 challenge. Challenge traffic should be redirected to this port if overridden.
        #
        # Optional. Default: 443.
        alt_tlsalpn_port: 443,

        # Challenge types
        #
        # Optional. Default: http-01. Possible values: http-01, tlsalpn-01
        challenge_type: http-01

        # Use production or staging endpoints. NOTE, try to use the staging endpoint (`use_production_endpoint`: `false`) to make sure, that everything works correctly.
        #
        # Optional, but for production should be set to true. Default: false
        use_production_endpoint: true

        # List of your domains to obtain certificates
        #
        # Mandatory. Error on empty.
        domains: [
            "your-cool-domain.here",
            "your-second-domain.here"
        ]
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Add a new option to the `logs` plugin to configure the line ending. By default, used `\n`.

**New option**:

```yaml
# Logs plugin settings
logs:
  (....)
  # Line ending
  #
  # Default: "\n".
  line_ending: "\n"
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è HTTP [Access log support](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/34) at the `Info` log level.

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:55555
  max_request_size: 1024
  access_logs: true <-------- Access Logs ON/OFF
  middleware: [ ]

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è HTTP middleware to handle `X-Sendfile` [header](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/9). Middleware
  reads the file in 10MB chunks. So, for example for the 5Gb file, only 10MB of RSS will be used. If the file size is
  smaller than 10MB, the middleware fits the buffer to the file size.

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:44444
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: [ "sendfile" ] <----- NEW MIDDLEWARE

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Service plugin now supports env variables passing to the script/executable/binary/any like in the `server` plugin:

```yaml
service:
  some_service_1:
    command: "php test_files/loop_env.php"
    process_num: 1
    exec_timeout: 5s # s,m,h (seconds, minutes, hours)
    remain_after_exit: true
    env: <----------------- NEW
      foo: "BAR"
    restart_sec: 1
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Server plugin can accept scripts (sh, bash, etc) in it's `command` configuration key:

```yaml
server:
  command: "./script.sh OR sh script.sh" <--- UPDATED
  relay: "pipes"
  relay_timeout: "20s"
```

The script should start a worker as the last command. For the `pipes`, scripts should not contain programs, which can
close `stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr`.

- ‚úèÔ∏è Nats jobs driver support - [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/pull/68).

```yaml
nats:
  addr: "demo.nats.io"

jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s

  pipelines:
    test-1:
      driver: nats
      prefetch: 100
      subject: "default"
      stream: "foo"
      deliver_new: "true"
      rate_limit: 100
      delete_stream_on_stop: false
      delete_after_ack: false
      priority: 2

  consume: [ "test-1" ]
```

- Driver uses NATS JetStream API and is not compatible with non-js API.


- ‚úèÔ∏è Response API for the NATS, RabbitMQ, SQS and Beanstalk drivers. This means, that you'll be able to respond to a
  specified in the response queue. Limitations:
    - To send a response to the queue maintained by the RR, you should send it as a `Job` type. There are no limitations
      for the responses into the other queues (tubes, subjects).
    - Driver uses the same endpoint (address) to send the response as specified in the configuration.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: local and global configuration parsing.
- üêõ Fix: `boltdb-jobs` connection left open after RPC close command.
- üêõ Fix: close `beanstalk` connection and release associated resources after pipeline stopped.
- üêõ Fix: grpc plugin fails to handle requests after calling `reset`.
- üêõ Fix: superfluous response.WriteHeader call when connection is broken.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: bug with not-idempotent call to the `attributes.Init`.
- üêõ Fix: memory jobs driver behavior. Now memory driver starts consuming automatically if the user consumes the
  pipeline in the configuration.

---

## v2.2.1 (13.05.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: revert static plugin. It stays as a separate plugin on the main route (`/`) and supports all the previously
  announced features.
- üêõ Fix: remove `build` and other old targets from the Makefile.

---

## v2.2.0 (11.05.2021)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è Reworked `static` plugin. Now, it does not affect the performance of the main route and persist on the separate
  file server (within the `http` plugin). Looong awaited feature: `Etag` (+ weak Etags) as well with the `If-Mach`
  , `If-None-Match`, `If-Range`, `Last-Modified`
  and `If-Modified-Since` tags supported. Static plugin has a bunch of new options such as: `allow`, `calculate_etag`
  , `weak` and `pattern`.

  ### Option `always` was deleted from the plugin.

- ‚úèÔ∏è Update `informer.List` implementation. Now it returns a list with the all available plugins in the runtime.

## ü©π Fixes:

---

## v2.1.1 (29.04.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: issue with endure provided wrong logger interface implementation.

## v2.1.0 (27.04.2021)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è New `service` plugin. Docs: [link](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/beep-beep-service)
- ‚úèÔ∏è Stabilize `kv` plugin with `boltdb`, `in-memory`, `memcached` and `redis` drivers.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: Logger didn't provide an anonymous log instance to a plugins w/o `Named` interface implemented.
- üêõ Fix: http handler was without log listener after `rr reset`.

## v2.0.4 (06.04.2021)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è Add support for `linux/arm64` platform for docker image (thanks @tarampampam).
- ‚úèÔ∏è Add dotenv file support (`.env` in working directory by default; file location can be changed using CLI
  flag `--dotenv` or `DOTENV_PATH` environment variable) (thanks @tarampampam).
- üìú Add a new `raw` mode for the `logger` plugin to keep the stderr log message of the worker unmodified (logger
  severity level should be at least `INFO`).
- üÜï Add Readiness probe check. The `status` plugin provides `/ready` endpoint which return the `204` HTTP code if there
  are no workers in the `Ready` state and `200 OK` status if there are at least 1 worker in the `Ready` state.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: bug with the temporal worker which does not follow general graceful shutdown period.

## v2.0.3 (29.03.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: slow last response when reached `max_jobs` limit.

## v2.0.2 (06.04.2021)

- üêõ Fix: Bug with required Root CA certificate for the SSL, now it's optional.
- üêõ Fix: Bug with incorrectly consuming metrics collector from the RPC calls (thanks @dstrop).
- üÜï New: HTTP/FCGI/HTTPS internal logs instead of going to the raw stdout will be displayed in the RR logger at
  the `Info` log level.
- ‚ö° New: Builds for the Mac with the M1 processor (arm64).
